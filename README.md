# Wheel meta boxes
This facilitates access to the meta box pane through use of the mouse wheel or scrolling touch gestures. There are a couple of ways thatâ€™s done.
 
## Automatically when scrolling to the end of the post content
When the post content is scrolled to the end it reveals the meta box pane. When the meta box pane is scrolled to the start it hides the meta box pane.

## Voluntary in combination with keyboard input
Press and hold the <kbd>Control</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and use the mouse wheel or scroll gesture over either the post content or the meta boxes to adjust the split while maintaining scroll positions in both the content and the meta boxes.

## Configuration
Both of the behaviors aren enabled by default. If either one isn't helpful it can be disabled in the sidebar.
