# Wheel meta boxes
This enables use of the mouse wheel to minimize and maximize the meta box pane. If the post content is scrolled to the end it maximizes the meta box pane. If the meta box pane is scrolled to the start it minimizes the meta box pane.

## Quicker access & maintained scroll positions
Hold the <kbd>Control</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while wheeling to to adjust the split without having to scroll through content in either the canvas or the meta box pane.

**Note:** Some browsers may use this same combination for changing the zoom or font size. To avoid that try also holding another modifier key like <kbd>Alt</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>.
